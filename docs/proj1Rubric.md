Prepare a markdown with **three** columns:

-   Column1 has all the following points PLUS all the points from the [Software Sustainability Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform).
-   Column2 is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero (none), one (a litte), two (somewhat), three (a lot).
-   Column3 is for any links you are adding to support your claim in column two.
-   At the top, show the sum of column2
