### Purpose
Discord is a social platform where users interact with each other through servers, channels, and separate chats for various reasons. Creating polls is a common way to ask questions and collect opinions, especially with large number of users. However, existing Discord bots and UIs currently provides a simplified version of creating and managing polls. 

Pollcord is a software created for Discord users to conduct polls, providing a comprehensive solution in conducting polls. PollCord is built using Pycord, which is a cutting edge API wrapper for Discord, to create a modern interactive experience compared to most other Discord poll bots.


## PollCord Features
- Easy & user friendly interface to create polls
- Create & aggregate Multiple questions onto a single poll
- Creator-only permissions
- Up to 25 options for each poll question
- Integrated database to store and recall/extract poll results whenever needed


## Documentation

## Future Scope

- *Open-ended text questions for polls*: By augmenting the requirements of a question given the flexible database design, PollCord can support open-ended text questions as opposed to only multiple-choice questions
- *Compatible with different applications*: By only requiring changes to the frontend, PollCord can be scaled to implement on different Applications like Slack, Microsoft Teams
- *Enhanced functionality with polls*: PollCord can be modified to incorporate additional features along with polls. Features like forms linked with individual users can also be added
