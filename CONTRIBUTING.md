## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/ntgomes/PollCord/issueshttps://github.com/ntgomes/PollCord/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/ntgomes/PollCord/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.


## How can I Contribute

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the projects quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for the projects maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution reviewed by the maintainers:

1. Include a clear and descriptive title.
2. Include a description of the change.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
